# Wikipedia Search Engine

A full-stack web application that allows users to search Wikipedia articles using a React frontend and an Express backend that acts as a proxy to the Wikipedia API.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/          #Express.js backend
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/         #React frontend built with Vite
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      #Root scripts and combined dev setup
```

## Features

- Search Wikipedia using the official API
- React 19 frontend (with Vite)
- Express backend handles API proxying
- Unified deployment on a single server (e.g. Render)

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Install frontend and backend dependencies
- Build the frontend using Vite (output goes to `frontend/build`)
- Backend serves the built frontend along with API
